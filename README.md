### Architecture/Layout
The app is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) as the state container. 

The files/folder structure are a  **WIP** and may contain some unused files. The project is rapidly evolving so please update this section if you see it is inaccurate!
